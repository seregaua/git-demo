For time flies and it's so slow
I'm up and down like a yo-yo
I can't do it on my own
And I've tried and I can't pull the sword from the stone
I told you I was through
All that I ever knew was you (was you), was you (was you)
Leaving was something I though you and I, we could never do
So where did all the time fly?
Oh, so where did all the time die?
Oh, we didn't even say goodbye

How you feeling, sweetheart?
Are you moving on?
Are you sleeping okay
Or do the nights go on and on?
I hope you're eating well
I hope you're staying strong
'Cause I'm fine, then I'm not
I'm spinning round and I can't stop
I can't do this alone
For time flies and it's so slow
I'm up and down like a yo-yo
