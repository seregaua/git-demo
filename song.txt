For time flies and it's so slow
I'm up and down like a yo-yo
I can't do it on my own
And I've tried and I can't pull the sword from the stone
I told you I was through
All that I ever knew was you (was you), was you (was you)
Leaving was something I though you and I, we could never do
So where did all the time fly?
Oh, so where did all the time die?
Oh, we didn't even say goodbye
